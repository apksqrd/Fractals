Parameters
default_settings::X_SAMPLE_SIZE,
default_settings::X_SAMPLE_RANGE,
default_settings::Y_SAMPLE_SIZE,
default_settings::Y_SAMPLE_RANGE,
num_samples: 100000000,
start_iteration: 2,
default_settings::MAX_ITERATIONS,
num_thread_split_layers: 4

Default settings (might have been used in parameters):
pub const X_SAMPLE_SIZE: usize = 4096; // not sure if usize is correct for this
pub const X_SAMPLE_RANGE: (NumberType, NumberType) = (-2.1, 2.1);
pub const Y_SAMPLE_SIZE: usize = 4096;
pub const Y_SAMPLE_RANGE: (NumberType, NumberType) = (-2.1, 2.1);
pub const MAX_ITERATIONS: u64 = 500;

Elapsed: 92.28s

Notes:
    This should have been the same in terms of the results as 100000000 random samples.
    The only difference should've been the multithreading, but this one seems brighter
    (I might've changd the algorithm for density to grays without realizing it).
