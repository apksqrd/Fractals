Note:
    Whew! That took a while (around 2 hour 20 min).
    I ran it right before bed, and I've never really done something this big
    so I was worried that something bad would happen. luckily it turned out pretty cool.
    I'm not getting the really cool and sharp images like I wanted,
    but I think I am done with the Buddhabrot set for now.
